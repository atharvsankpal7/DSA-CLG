[SANMESH, AYUSH, PRAJAKTA, and PRAJWAL are sitting at a conference table]

SANMESH: (pointing to a whiteboard) Okay, team, let's talk about the ATM software. We need to develop a system that is reliable, efficient, and secure.

AYUSH: (nodding) I think I have an idea of how we can do that.

PRAJWAL: (raising her hand) Before we dive into the technical details, can we talk about the structured design methodology we'll be using for this project?

PRAJAKTA: (smiling) That's a great idea, PRAJWAL. It's important that we establish a clear process for developing the software.

SANMESH: (smiling) Agreed. We'll be following a process that involves breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

AYUSH: (leaning in) That sounds interesting. How does it work?

SANMESH: (drawing on the whiteboard) First, we create a flowchart that outlines the logical sequence of actions that occur in the system.

PRAJWAL: (nodding) And then we write the code based on the flowchart.

PRAJAKTA: (smiling) That's right. After that, we test the code to ensure that it meets the system requirements. This includes functional testing, stress testing, and security testing.

AYUSH: (writing down notes) I see. And after that?

SANMESH: (smiling) We install the system at its final location and connect it to the bank's network.

PRAJWAL: (nodding) That's a great process. But how can we ensure that the code is reliable and efficient?

SANMESH: (smiling) That's a great question, PRAJWAL. We'll be using design patterns to ensure that the code is modular and easy to maintain. And we'll be using data structures and algorithms to ensure that the code is efficient.

AYUSH: (nodding) I see. And how will we ensure that the code is secure?

PRAJAKTA: (smiling) We'll be following industry-standard security protocols to ensure that the code is secure. And we'll be using penetration testing to identify and fix any vulnerabilities in the system.

PRAJWAL: (smiling) That sounds like a comprehensive approach.

SANMESH: (smiling) It is. And with our team working together, I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver a high-quality ATM system that meets all the requirements.

PRAJAKTA: (smiling) I couldn't agree more.

AYUSH: (smiling) I'm excited to get started.

PRAJWAL: (smiling) Me too.

SANMESH: (smiling) Great. Let's get to work.

[The four of them smile and get up from the table]
